                         TSA (Technology Student Association) is a national organization 
                         comprised of students devoted to science, technology, engineering,
                         &amp; mathematics. TSA has over 250,000 members in middle &amp; high school
                         across the United States. Said members learn through projects, 
                         competitive events, leadership opportunities, &amp; much more.
                         This influence from TSA will bring what is needed for a technological erudite society.

                    <p>
                        We are HHS TSA club, competing in our second TSA season. The officers of this club observe and guide the community and help student on future career making choices affiliated with TSA competitions.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Despite are struggles, our officers are very persistent and established TSA in August 2017. Our club was founded with people who really wanted to introduce to the school club fair, where we recruited 24 new loyal members. The chapter has collectively participated in 17 state events in the first year. This year we are competing in 29 events this year.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The motto is "Learning to lead in a technical world."

                        HHS TSA held it's very own tech fair from last year to recruit more members. Since our team is very busy constatly doing their best for state & nationals, the tech fair was held during both lunches. The projects presented were music production, digital video production, dragster, flight, children stories, architectual design, and video game design. Go team!
