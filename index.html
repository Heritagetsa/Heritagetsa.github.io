    <h2>What Is TSA?</h2>
    <p>
     The Technology Student Association is a national, non-profit organization that works around creating the brightest future leaders in the STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, Mathematics) fields. The organization hosts over 70 middle and high school competitions a year filled with over 250,000 members. The events at said competitions test the abilities of students nationwide, the TSA members can represent their school, community, and sometimes even their state. 
     <br>
     <br>
     TSA's motto "Learning To Lead In A Technical World" is what the organization promotes. The club has members in 48 out of the 50 states.

    <h2>Who We Are</h2>
    <p>
      We are the HHS TSA club. We are a group of aspiring leaders that focus on our own interests, along with helping others find their own. This is our club's second year participating in various events. After previous years of gaining experience from TSA, the current secretary and president believed in continuing on the legacy and expanding the opportunities to other students. They thought, "Why not in our very own high school?" Our chapter specifically, is known for being eccentric, passionate, and full of support. 
      <br>
      <br>
      Although there was a problem with recruiting members at first, the determination of the clubs founders did not waver. After a technology fair and other methods of recruitment, the HHS TSA club has a loyal, motivated chapter of 24. The chapter participated in 22 events for the second time at the FL state conference. We will compete in 15 competitive events at the Washington DC National Conference from June 27th to July 2nd. 
    </p>
    <h2>Creed</h2>
    <p>I believe that Technology Education holds an important place in my life in the technical world. I believe there is a need for the development of good attitudes concerning work, tools, materials, experimentation, and processes of industry. Guided by my teachers, artisans from industry, and my own initiative, I will strive to do my best in making my school, community, state, and nation better places in which to live.
      <br>
      <br>
    I will accept the responsibilities that are mine. I will accept the theories that are supported by proper evidence. I will explore on my own for safer, more effective methods of working and living. I will strive to develop a cooperative attitude and will exercise tact and respect for other individuals. Through the work of my hands and mind, I will express my ideas to the best of my ability. I will make it my goal to do better each day the task before me, and to be steadfast in my belief in my God, and my fellow Americans.
